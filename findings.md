# Findings of CohortBant Smart Contract

CohortBant Smart Contract is a simple deposit and withdrawal contract witha an unlocktime, however as beautiful as this contract is, it is not without loopholes in it.

# DEPOSIT FUNCTION

The code block provided appears to be a simple function to allow users to deposit funds to the contract. However, there are a few potential vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy Attack: The code is not protected against reentrancy attacks. If an attacker were to call a function that executes before the require statement (e.g., a function that updates the sender's balance), the attacker could repeatedly call the deposit() function to withdraw more funds than they deposited. To mitigate this risk, you can add a reentrancy guard to the function using the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern.

2. Lack of Access Control: The deposit() function is public, meaning anyone can call it and deposit funds to the contract. If the contract has other functions that require access control (e.g., only the contract owner can withdraw funds), this could be a vulnerability. To prevent unauthorized access, you can implement a role-based access control system.

3.Lack of Input Validation: The require statement checks whether the msg.value is greater than 0, but it does not validate other inputs (e.g., whether the sender's address is valid). To prevent invalid inputs, you can add additional validation checks to the function.

# WITHDRAWAL FUNCTION

The vulnerability in the provided code is that the function withdraw() transfers the entire balance of the contract to the owner's address, regardless of the amount specified in the function argument 'amount'. This means that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by passing in a large value for 'amount' and cause the entire balance of the contract to be transferred to the owner's address.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should transfer only the specified 'amount' to the owner's address instead of transferring the entire balance. The modified code can look like this:

function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {

require(block.timestamp >= unlockTime, "You can't withdraw yet");

require(msg.sender == owner, "You aren't the owner");

require(amount <= address(this).balance, "Insufficient balance");

emit Withdrawal(amount, block.timestamp);

payable(owner).transfer(amount);

}

Here, I have added a new require statement to check if the contract has sufficient balance to transfer the specified 'amount'. I have also modified the transfer statement to transfer only the specified 'amount' to the owner's address using the payable keyword. This ensures that the function withdraw() can only transfer the amount specified in the function argument and not the entire contract balance.
