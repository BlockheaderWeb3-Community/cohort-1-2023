# Solidity Examples

This repository contains a collection of Solidity examples that students can use to learn about smart contracts and blockchain development.

## Examples

This repository contains the following Solidity examples:

- [Interfaces.sol](./001_Interfaces.sol) - A simple smart contract that demonstrates how to use interfaces to interact with other contracts in a decentralized system. 

- [ContractCalling.sol](./002_ContractCalling.sol) - A simple smart  contract that imports and calls functions from the IdGenerator contract

- [ContractCreator.sol](./003_ContractCreator.sol) -The code contains two Solidity contracts, "Student" and "Registration", that allow the registration of students and create a contract for them and retrieval of their details using a Student contract array.
